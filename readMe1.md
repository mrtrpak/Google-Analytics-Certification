## Why Google Analytics

- If **marketer, business owner or entrepreneur** then is probably most important tool to use.
- Thrive on the ability to make data-driven decisions.
-  Gives you the metrics to see what is working and what isn't working.
-  Flying blind without analytics in place. "If you can't measure it, you can't prove it." Peter Drucker
-  Is the **industry standard** for web analytics and is a requirement for digital marketing or ads.

## How Does Google Analytics Works

- To collect data, a small piece of **tracking code** is added to EACH page on a website. 
- The code will collect **anonymous** info about a visitor interactions with the site.
- Google Analytics can calculate which pages are most popular or determine if users reached purchase page.
- Collect info like **language of browser, type of browser, the device used, operating system used, 
users location, age and gender.**
- Also collects the **"traffic source"** which brought the user to the site in the first place.
- EX: search engine, ad clicked on or an email marketing campaign.
- Uses a **Browser cookie** (small bit of text stored in the browser) to generate random ID to 
distinguish between new and returning visitors and tie all the activity of a visitor into single visit.
- Each period of activity is called a **session**. It ends a session by default after 30 minutes of 
inactivity or when a user closes a browser.
- All this info is sent to Google Analytics to populate your reports.

## Google Analytics Setup

1) Create or sign in to Analytics account
2) Setup a property (represents your website or app and is the collection point in Analytics for data).
3) Add the tracking code to site. Admin > tracking info > add after opening tag on each page.
4) Verifty code is working by opening up website in separate tab and check Analytics.

## Create Reporting Views

- **Views:** The level in an Analytics account where you can access reports and analysis tools.
- **Google Analytics recommends** you setup at least **3 views:** a "raw data", "test" and "master" view.

- **Raw Data View:** left unfiltered and untouched. Can always go back to all the data that was collected.
- **Test View:** test new filters to see how traffic gets affected. Test first to make sure you are not
filtrating any visitors that you otherwise would expect to show up to have more reliable data.
- **Master View:** main view to use to read your data day to day. Already tested filters are added here.

**How to Create Additional Views**
1) **Add a new reporting view.** Admin section of your property and click "create view".
2) **Add view name and timezone.** Then click "create view".

**Limits and Caveats of Views**
- default unfiltered view will be called **"All Website Data"** and can rename view to match view name 
recommendations by Google Analytics.
- When new view is created only the website data from the **date the view was created** is included.
- If you delete a view you have **35 Days** to restore the view.

**Account Structure**
- **Account:** Access point for analytics and the top-most level of organization.
- **Property:** Website, mobile app or device. Up to **50 Properties** for each account.
- **View:** Access point for reports. Defined view of data from property. Up to **25 Views** to per property.

**Why Create Additional Views?**
- When you add a property to an account, Analytics creates a **reporting view** for that property.
- **Best practice** to leave the original view unchanged. Then always has **backup** of raw data.
- Can create additional views and apply filters to them to view a specific subset of data
- **You want to do this b/c:**
    - **Convenience:** if consistently need to look at a particular subset of data, it is easier to 
    have a view that is dedicated to that data.
    - **Data Security:** give the editorial team access to analytics reports about company, but can
    restrict access to sensitive data.
    - **Data Accuracy:** filter data like spam traffic or internal traffic.
