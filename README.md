## Why Google Analytics

- If **marketer, business owner or entrepreneur** then is probably most important tool to use.
- Thrive on the ability to make data-driven decisions.
-  Gives you the metrics to see what is working and what isn't working.
-  Flying blind without analytics in place. "If you can't measure it, you can't prove it." Peter Drucker
-  Is the **industry standard** for web analytics and is a requirement for digital marketing or ads.

## How Does Google Analytics Works

- To collect data, a small piece of **tracking code** is added to EACH page on a website. 
- The code will collect **anonymous** info about a visitor interactions with the site.
- Google Analytics can calculate which pages are most popular or determine if users reached purchase page.
- Collect info like **language of browser, type of browser, the device used, operating system used, 
users location, age and gender.**
- Also collects the **"traffic source"** which brought the user to the site in the first place.
- EX: search engine, ad clicked on or an email marketing campaign.
- Uses a **Browser cookie** (small bit of text stored in the browser) to generate random ID to 
distinguish between new and returning visitors and tie all the activity of a visitor into single visit.
- Each period of activity is called a **session**. It ends a session by default after 30 minutes of 
inactivity or when a user closes a browser.
- All this info is sent to Google Analytics to populate your reports.

## Google analytics Setup

4) Add the tracking code to your site. Admin > tracking info > add after opening <head> tag on each page.
5) Verify that the tracking code is working. Open website in serparate tab and check on analytics.
